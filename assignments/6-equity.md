# Internet Equity

The Federal Communications Commission (FCC), advocacy groups, scholars, and
others interested in Internet performance have had wide-ranging discussions
over the years on two related (but distinct) topics: (1) benchmarking Internet
performance standards  (“Am I getting what I’m paying for?”); and (2) equity
(“digital divide” challenges, Internet access haves and have-nots). Various
organizations, from regulators to public interest groups, have developed tools,
methods, and datasets to try to answer these questions.

## Overview 

In 2021, the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act authorized $65 billion to
expand broadband access and adoption, and address disparities highlighted by
the COVID pandemic and the shift to remote work, school and health care. But to
invest that funding most effectively for improving digital equity in the United
States, new and deep data at a local scale must be gathered and analyzed to
drive effective policy and advocacy solutions for the citizens and
neighborhoods most in need.

In this exercise you will explore how Internet performance in a specific
high-income neighborhood compares with Internet performance in a specific
low-income neighborhood. 

### Part 1: Basic Data Exploration

### Part 2: Neighborhood-Level Exploration

## Going Further

Approaches such as those you have explored in this assignment could provide
researchers and policymakers an opportunity to offer citizens a data-driven
approach to address their core concerns about Internet equity. 

How would you frame and formulate questions concerning equity and “digital
redlining” in ways that could be suppoted by data analysis?
