# Internet Performance

One of the main things that the Internet needs to do is perform well, so that
it can provide a good user experience to users. Measuring Internet performance
is challenging, as there are many dimensions to performance, which vary over
time. 

Some of these metrics are complex, and can be difficult for consumers to
understand. By the end of this activity, you will understand the basic metrics
for measuring Internet performance, as well as some of the challenges in
accurately measuring performance.


## Overview 

Internet performance involves many metrics, including the following:
  - Throughput (``speed'')
  - Latency
  - Jitter
  - Packet loss rate
  - Latency under load, or responsiveness
All of these affect the performance of Internet applications in different
ways. One of the difficulties in measuring and characterizing Internet
performance is that performance is multi-dimensional; another aspect of
performance measurement that is so challenging is that performance varies over
time.  

The tools we will use in the assignment below are used for a variety of
purposes, from troubleshooting Internet connections to generating maps
concerning Internet performance and coverage across geographies (e.g., cities,
states). The data is problematic for generating coverage maps; yet, even for
understanding performance of a single Internet connection, the tools can be
tricky to use and make sense of, as we will explore below.

## Activity

In this activity, we will explore the different components of measuring
Internet performance, notably an Internet speed test. You will run an Internet
speed test under a variety of conditions, multiple times to see how the
performance metrics vary over time, under repeated runs, and under different
conditions.

### Part 1: Basic Speedtest

1. Open up your web browser and go to `https://speedtest.net/`.
2. Run a speed test by clicking "Go" on the web page.
3. Make note of the following values:
    - Upload Throughput
    - Download Throughput
    - Latency
    - Ping (latency)
    - Upstream Server
    - Your Internet Service Provider
4. Enter the values above into the following [web form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/18e_ZR8xR_MdjVy_AWqM4UrXNKUXgUe-2uiT6hqSQqX0/edit).

### Part 2: Varying the conditions

1. Run the same test again above.
    - Do you see the same numbers? Why or why not?
2. Repeat the above steps with the following variations:
    - On your cell phone (with and without WiFi turned on)
    - From the [Measurement Lab website](https://speed.measurementlab.net/#/).
3. Think about the following questions:
    - What differences do you notice?
